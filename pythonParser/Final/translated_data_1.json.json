The focus is on the systematic recording and close discussion of social conflict lines and integration arenas. The seminar on the topic of lines of conflict and arenas of integration in modern society acts as a problem-related introduction to sociological theory at an advanced level. Central lines of conflict in society are identified, disintegration dynamics are shown, power relationships are analyzed and mechanisms of cohesion are discussed. The focus of the content is on current conflicts between rich and poor, East and West, functional elites and the population, young and old, men and women or labor and capital. The seminar on the topic of collective identity and political culture serves to analyze and evaluate contemporary identity-political interpretation struggles from a sociologically informed perspective. On the one hand, this involves reflecting on contingent sources of identity formation (language, religion, ethnicity, nation, etc.).

The seminar Democracy, Civil Society and Extremism deals with the analysis of changes in democratic structures and processes. The core topics are questions of legitimacy, ability to integrate and performance of democracies. In this context, it is particularly important to provide an empirically based insight into the threat to the basic democratic order posed by the emergence of extremist groups and the success of populist parties. As part of the seminar Digital Community and Separation, integration and disintegration processes that are caused, supported and reflected by digital media are dealt with at an advanced level. With particular attention to an internet and technological sociological perspective, the use of social media, but also the internet in general, is discussed with regard to the two extremes of community and isolation. Aim:The aim of the module is to get to know and theoretically understand the current scientific discussion about integration and disintegration processes in modern societies. The aim is to expand the ability to confront theoretical approaches with empirical findings and to question them critically. It also shows how scientific results, for example from extremism research, relate to current everyday issues and what implications arise. Another aim of the module is to convey the theoretical and methodological foundations as well as empirical research results of the sociology of technology and the Internet in relation to digital processes of community and isolation and thus the basis for independent scientific work in these to place fields.

It provides the instruments, the mathematical structures and methods for solving technical problems. The main focus of the module is the following: Basics (logic, set theory, number ranges) Differential and integral calculus for functions of a variable Differential calculus for Functions of several variables Basic concepts of linear algebra and linear optimization Ordinary differential equations Aim:Sufficiently good knowledge of mathematics, including terms, structures and methods, is a basic requirement for the successful completion of a technical degree. The aim of the module is for the student to acquire the necessary basic knowledge. The student masters the mathematical concepts and the mathematical calculus with the aim of having a solid basis for the independent formulation and solution of mathematical problems, which occur particularly in technical applications. The aim of the internships is to acquire methodological skills in the independent application of mathematical concepts and solution methods. The internships replace part of the working hours that would otherwise be spent on self-study.",

Furthermore, important soldering processes as well as typical solders for soft and hard soldering of various base materials are explained. The soldering of non-metallic materials, such as ceramics, glasses and graphite, as well as the special features of soldering these materials are also covered. Further sections deal with design guidelines for the correct construction and testing of solder connections, solders and fluxes.

In this way, the conflict of objectives, which is crucial for production technology: high productivity versus high precision, can be resolved at a high level become. The module covers fundamental aspects of mechanical engineering design and development, starting with drive assemblies through the machine to the manufacturing system. This includes interdisciplinary solution approaches that are necessary for a targeted improvement of machine parameters. Starting from the classic spindle-nut systems, the focus is on drive principles that enable the machine developer to design machines and components more accurately and productively at the same time. These include highly dynamic parallel kinematics as well as piezoelectric precision drives and their combination. In addition, basic principles of machine installation and functional machine safety are discussed. The module also includes the structure and components of multi-machine systems. In addition to the linking of machines, process integration in machine tools and the modularization of production technology are discussed here. Finally, machine technology options for increasing and quantifying productivity and profitability are presented. Based on the lecture, the teaching material is deepened in exercises and internships. The classic calculation exercises are supplemented by exercises with simulation software in the PC pool and internships in the test field. A collection of tasks helps students apply the knowledge they have learned using small examples.

Students who did not acquire their university entrance qualification in a German-speaking country can apply to the examination board for the practical translation exercise through a one-semester course in German (with a learning objective of at least level A2 of the Common European Framework of Reference for Languages). Aim:The students can translate texts from different areas in a linguistically correct, stylistically appropriate and appropriate manner. They are able to approach any text from a translational perspective and, using current digital technologies, to process it in a way that is appropriate for the recipient and to justify their decisions linguistically.",

English for Academic Purposes offers the basics and advanced skills of academic work in English: Students learn to critically analyze academic texts. Students also train to gain access to relevant academic resources and gather targeted information. Particular attention is paid to the detection of predatory publishers. In addition, participants familiarize themselves with the challenges of academic writing by being confronted with various rhetorical and stylistic elements that are typical of academic texts. Due to the key role that academic writing plays in communicating research results and the dialogue with the research community, strategies for writing an academic paper are developed several times throughout the semester. The students are also supported in finding how they can structure their self-study. In addition, students will be familiarized with and learn various citation standards (APA, MLA and Unified Style Sheet for Linguistics). the necessary skills to transmit academic writing in one of these styles. Aim:The students can learn independently and in a self-organized manner. You can critically analyze scientific texts. You will learn vocabulary and formulations as well as tips on building and structuring a scientific paper and can apply these to your own research work. Students will be able to write an article for an academic journal using appropriate rhetoric and style. In addition, they are able to gain access to a wide variety of scientific sources and identify predatory publishers.",
