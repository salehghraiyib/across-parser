# Across Python Parser

Extracts data from pdf files that describe university modules, it currently is adapted for use to 3 universities but will be updated to include more in the future

## Overview

Across Parser project aims to automate the extraction of module information from study regulations documents provided by educational institutions in the Across alliance. The process involves running a parser modified for each structure of the various module descriptions found in these documents. The extracted data is then stored in JSON format and saved locally for further analysis and use.

Most code were commented out and run manually because of the differences in pdf's even from the same university -- it was tinkered and changed for each pdf or module description or whenever we are faced with an error

## Disclaimer

This helped us achieve our goal of attaining a sufficient data sample that allows us to test the features of the system, until there is an agreement on how modules are to be provided in the future automaticlaly by the unviersities. **Will be discontinued sometime when there is an offical means of importing modules**
